## Work

I've just launched my redesigned website. It's something I do roughly every two years to keep on top of new trends and technologies.

I've switched from Gatsby to [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) &mdash; a static site generator written in JavaScript which is lightning fast!

## Reading

I've been reading [Rich Dad's Cashflow Quadrant](https://amzn.to/2Jgo3Z4) by Robert Kiyosaki for a while now. Progress has been slow, but I'm going to stick with it.

## Watching

I'm currently watching [Schitt's Creek](https://www.netflix.com/title/80036165) and working my way through all the <abbr title="Marvel Cinematic Universe">MCU</abbr> movies in release order.

## Gaming

I recently reached [100% completion](https://www.reddit.com/r/Breath_of_the_Wild/comments/g44qc1/this_is_both_satisfying_and_quite_upsetting/) on The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Took me a little over 180 hours of game play but it was totally worth it!

I'm really excited to see what the sequel to Breath of the Wild has to offer. Bring it on!
