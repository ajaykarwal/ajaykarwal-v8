## Work

I've just launched my redesigned website. It's something I do roughly every two years to keep on top of new trends and technologies.

I've switched from Gatsby to [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) &mdash; a static site generator written in JavaScript which is lightning fast!

<!-- ## Reading

I've been reading [Rich Dad's Cashflow Quadrant](https://amzn.to/2Jgo3Z4) by Robert Kiyosaki for a while now. Progress has been slow, but I'm going to stick with it.

## Watching

I've recently completed [The Witcher](https://www.netflix.com/title/80189685) and binged through [The IT Crowd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_IT_Crowd) which couldn't be more different. Both were pretty great!

## Music Production

In the late 90's up until around 2008, I used to DJ under the name 'Keynote' and also dabbled in producing music, mainly drum and bass.

After a break of over 10 years, I've started to get back into it and have spent the past year working on several new tracks. Now producing music under the name **Soul Concept**, I've started adding new music to my [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/soul-concept/tracks) page!
