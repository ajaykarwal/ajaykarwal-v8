## Work

I've just launched my redesigned website. It's something I do roughly every two years to keep on top of new trends and technologies.

I've switched from Gatsby to [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) &mdash; a static site generator written in JavaScript which is lightning fast!

<!-- ## Reading

I've been reading [Rich Dad's Cashflow Quadrant](https://amzn.to/2Jgo3Z4) by Robert Kiyosaki for a while now. Progress has been slow, but I'm going to stick with it.

## Watching

I'm currently watching [Snowpiercer](https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/80177458) and [Superstore](https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/80061132) which are both great and my kids and I are working our way through all the <abbr title="Marvel Cinematic Universe">MCU</abbr> movies in release order.

## Music Production

In the late 90's up until around 2008, I used to DJ under the name 'Keynote' and also dabbled in producing music, mainly drum and bass. I have some old tunes up on my [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/ajaykarwal) page which are worth a listen.

After a break of over 10 years, I've started to get back into it and have spent the past few weeks working on several new tracks. I'll be putting them up on Soundcloud once I'm happy with them so watch this space!
