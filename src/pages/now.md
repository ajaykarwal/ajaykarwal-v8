## Work

As an avid Notion user, I've started working on a side project for [Notion Power Users](https://notionpowerusers.com/), blogging about workflows, resources, tips and more that power users of Notion would find useful.

I've also been busy [setting up a newsletter](https://ajaykarwal.substack.com/) where I share weekly thoughts and links on stuff I find interesting.

<!-- ## Watching

I've recently completed [The Witcher](https://www.netflix.com/title/80189685) and binged through [The IT Crowd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_IT_Crowd) which couldn't be more different. Both were pretty great!

## Music Production

In the late 90's up until around 2008, I used to DJ under the name 'Keynote' and also dabbled in producing music, mainly drum and bass.

After a break of over 10 years, I've started to get back into it and have spent the past year working on several new tracks. Now producing music under the name **Soul Concept**, I've started adding new music to my [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/soul-concept/tracks) page!
