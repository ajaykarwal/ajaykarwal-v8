## Work

I've been busy [setting up a newsletter](https://ajaykarwal.substack.com/) where I share weekly thoughts and links on stuff I find interesting.

## Reading

I'm currently reading [I Will Teach You To Be Rich](https://amzn.to/3O28Zju) by Remit Sethi.

Hoping the teaching pay off one day!

## Watching

I've currently watching [The Big Bang Theory](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0898266/). It's the first time I've sat and watched it all in order. Usually just picked up the odd episode when it's on. Loving it.

## Music Production

In the late 90's up until around 2008, I used to DJ under the name 'Keynote' and also dabbled in producing music, mainly drum and bass.

After a break of over 10 years, I've started to get back into it and have spent the past year working on several new tracks. Now producing music under the name **Soul Concept**, I've started adding new music to my [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/soulconceptuk/tracks) page!
