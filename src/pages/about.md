Hi, I'm Ajay Karwal. I've been building stuff on the web for over 20 years with a focus on frontend development, UI design and UX. 

I most enjoy projects where I can combine multiple disciplines and fully utilise my design, development and problem solving skills. I'm a fan of minimalism, typography and micro-interactions and obsess over small performance gains.

Over the past few years I've focused a lot on JavaScript frameworks and Single Page Applications built in React and Angular. I'm currently working as a senior frontend developer at Aiimi, building an enterprise search and analytics app.

I'm married, a father of two and currently living in Northampton, UK.

And this is what I look like.
