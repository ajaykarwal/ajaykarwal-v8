This week, Apple announced a slew of updates in their annual [Worldwide Developer Conference](https://www.apple.com/apple-events/). We saw previews of all the operating systems, a new 15” MacBook Air, updates to the Mac Pro and an brand new product — Apple Vision Pro.

While all of that was exciting, one thing that caught my eye was the new Journal app coming to [iOS17](https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-17-preview/).

> Journal is a new way to reflect on and relive special moments. Capture your thoughts on life’s big events or everyday activities. Add details to any entry with photos, music, audio recordings, and more. Mark important moments and revisit them later to find new insights or set new goals.
> 

And all this is going to be powered by A.I. (like everything else these days) to create suggestions of moments to add to your Journal based on photos, people, locations and more.

I’ve thought about journaling for a while and have tested out other apps like [Day One](https://dayoneapp.com/) in the past, but now that Journal is going to be a first-class citizen on the iPhone, it’s going to be easier than ever to get started, and I can’t wait to try it out.

My hope is that using Journal consistently might improve my writing and help shape the way I write in this newsletter.

What was your favourite moment from the WWDC2023 Keynote? Let me know in the comments.
