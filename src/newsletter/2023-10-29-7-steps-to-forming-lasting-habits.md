*Before we get started...*

*You may have noticed that I’ve been a bit quiet on the newsletter for the past couple of weeks. Sometimes life gets in the way and priorities need to be shifted around but hopefully I’ll return to a more regular schedule going forward. I might just switch the newsletter from being ‘weekly’ to a more irregular schedule.*

This week I’d like to talk about forming habits, and the 7 steps you can take to make them last.

I first came across this idea on an old episode of [The Side Hustle Show](https://www.sidehustlenation.com/side-hustle-show/) (sorry, I don’t recall the exact episode) and over time I’ve adapted it into my own seven ‘tion’ steps.

**1) Motivation** — Why do you want to do it?
Having a solid ‘why’ is the first step to achieving any goal. If you don’t know why you’re doing something, how will you really know if you’ve achieved it or not.

**2) Destination** — What’s the end goal?
Decide what you hope to achieve and make it realistic.

**3) Foundation** — How can you prepare? Mind, Body, Nutrition.
Depending on your goal, you may need to prepare before you actually start. Do whatever you can to prevent failure at the first step.

**4) Education** — Whose footsteps can you follow in?
Almost nothing is being done for the first time. Find someone who has already achieved what you’re trying to and mimic their steps.

**5) Execution** — Make a plan and do the work.
You’re fully prepared. Now it’s time to get stuck in. Make a plan and stick to it. Takes notes and be conscious of your progress.

**6) Reflection** — What went well/bad? Why?
Check in on yourself regularly to see if you’re on track to meet your goal. It helps if you have a way to track your progress, otherwise just ask yourself what’s going good or bad.

**7) Repetition** — Form a habit
Show up consistently and keep repeating to form a lasting habit. According to [James Clear](https://amzn.to/3FxsU4X), author of Atomic Habits, [it takes around 66 days for new behaviours to become automatic](https://jamesclear.com/new-habit#:~:text=On%20average%2C%20it%20takes%20more,to%20form%20a%20new%20habit).

To conclude, forming habits requires motivation, setting clear goals, preparation, learning from others, consistent execution, self-reflection, and repetition. By following these steps, you can increase your chances of successfully integrating new behaviors into your daily life and achieving long-lasting habits.
