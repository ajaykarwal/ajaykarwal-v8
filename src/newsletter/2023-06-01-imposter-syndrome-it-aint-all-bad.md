I was listening to [this episode on Imposter Syndrome](https://foundersjournal.morningbrew.com/how-to-deal-with-imposter-syndrome-1/) from The Crazy Ones podcast last week.

It got me thinking about the effects of imposter syndrome but also about how it’s not always a bad thing.

For clarification, **Imposter Syndrome** is a feeling of self-doubt or inadequacy that can make a person feel like they don't deserve their accomplishments. This is commonly found in the workplace when starting a new position which has more responsibility/reward than your previous job, but it can occur in all walks of life.

Some of the ways Imposter Syndrome has affected me over the years include:

- **Shifting careers**. I went from graphic designer, to senior developer over the past 10 years but there’s [still so much I don’t know](/blog/stuff-i-dont-know/) and with each job change or promotion it feels like I’m an imposter.
- **Becoming a parent**. Nobody can prepare you for this one. It really makes you appreciate what your own parents went through!
- **Starting a newsletter**. Every week I get feelings of dread as I think, ‘who on earth is going to read this’, but here we are. **Thanks for subscribing!**

## It ain’t all bad

While it can be distressing, there are some benefits to imposter syndrome that can actually help you grow and succeed. It can motivate you to work harder and push yourself further to prove to yourself and others that you are capable, which can lead to greater achievement and personal growth.

It can push you towards a path of learning. If you feel like an imposter you might find yourself spending more time up-skilling and willing to learn from others which in fact cements the fact that you’re not a imposter.

It can also open doors to life changing experiences, simply because you put yourself in a position outside of your comfort zone. Leaning into the feeling of being an imposter instead of shying away from it can lead to huge success — something echoed by Mike Cannon-Brookes - CEO of Atlassian, in his TED talk “[How you can use impostor syndrome to your benefit](https://youtu.be/ZkwqZfvbdFw).**”**

So next time you feel like an imposter, lean into it. It may just lead to something amazing.
