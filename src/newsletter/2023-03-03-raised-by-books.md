This week I was sorting out my new bookshelf in my office and decided that a few of my old programming books no longer deserved space on the shelf.

This got me thinking about what used to happen to old books once they became irrelevant and how they helped us with our posture. I wrote about it [on the blog](https://ajaykarwal.com/blog/raised-by-books/).

Until next time.
