On Sunday 23rd July, everyone’s favourite entrepreneur and madman Elon Musk announced that Twitter will be rebranding as simply “X” - an “everything app”.

Twitter’s new CEO, [Linda Yaccarino says](https://twitter.com/lindayacc/status/1683213895463215104),

> X is the future state of unlimited interactivity – centred in audio, video, messaging, payments/banking – creating a global marketplace for ideas, goods, services, and opportunities. Powered by AI, X will connect us all in ways we’re just beginning to imagine.
> 

Time will tell to find out what that actually means.

In the meantime, Musk turned to the internet to come up with a logo in the early hours of the morning.

The internet answered with [@SawyerMerritt](https://twitter.com/SawyerMerritt/status/1682971056397512705) submitting a letter X taken straight from the [Special Alphabets 4](https://catalog.monotype.com/font/monotype/special-alphabets/4) font and on Tuesday the new ‘logo’ went live, replacing the globally recognisable Twitter bird and stripping the already dying platform of all its brand equity.🤦🏼

The new X logo projected on Twitter HQ

The memes shortly rolled in, the xvideos account got suspended, and [Twix](https://twitter.com/twix) started trending (you know.. Twitter + X = Twix).

Twitter has been on a steady decline since Musk took over and this latest change feels like the nail in the coffin to completely kill the service once and for all!
