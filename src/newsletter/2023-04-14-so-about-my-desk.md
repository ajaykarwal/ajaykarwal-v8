Since this publication is called â€˜**[From the Desk of Ajay Karwal](https://ajaykarwal.com/newsletter)**â€™ I thought itâ€™s about time I showed you my desk.

But before we get to thatâ€¦ let me point you to a blog post I wrote this week â€” [Why and How I Blog](https://ajaykarwal.com/blog/why-and-how-i-blog/). If youâ€™re thinking of starting your own blog, hopefully the post will give you a little inspiration to get started.

OK, back to the desk.

**Here it is. ðŸŽ‰**

Itâ€™s usually [quite messy](https://officesnapshots.com/2012/02/06/inspiration-the-messy-desks-of-einstein-jobs-and-twain/).</small>

Beautiful right? I love it ðŸ’Ÿ

Itâ€™s a black IKEA BEKANT desk with a Herman Miller Mirra 2 chair. Hereâ€™s a list of [everything else I use at my desk](https://ajaykarwal.com/uses/) if youâ€™re interested.

Itâ€™s a place for writing code and also making music.

The room is dark, yet has plenty of natural light when I need it.

And itâ€™s where Iâ€™m sitting right now, writing this.

What is your desk like? Iâ€™d love to see it. Head over to the Chat or [drop me a tweet](https://twitter.com/ajaykarwal).
