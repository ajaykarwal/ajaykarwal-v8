I love RSS.

I’ve loved it since I first discovered [Google Reader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Reader) (R.I.P) in the mid 2000’s. Back then, RSS was the best source for getting updates from the people you wanted to follow. It was easy to [set up a blog for free](https://www.blogger.com/about/) and the tools were already in place to help you get noticed.

Then Twitter happened.

While I still followed all my RSS feeds (my app of choice now is [Feedly](https://feedly.com/)) I noticed that people were blogging less and things shifted towards more fleeting content in Tweets.

But recently, since [Twitter is pretty much destoying itself](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-64804007), there’s been a bit of a resurgence in blogging, and because of this, RSS is on the rise once more.

People are taking back control of their content and I love that.

Happy blogging!
