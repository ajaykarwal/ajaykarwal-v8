The Chinese philosopher [Laozi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laozi) says,

> "A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step"

Taking a single step puts one foot in front of the other. You get a taste of what’s ahead of you but you don’t make any real progress.

You need to take a second step to actually move forward, and then rely on momentum to keep moving.

Put in the effort. Take a second step.

> "If you do not change direction, you may end up where you are heading."
