Last week I gave a speech at my sisters wedding. It went down pretty well and for the first time in a long time I didn’t feel nervous speaking in front of a crowd.

It could be that the crowd was mostly family, or it could have been the drinks I’d had leading up to the speech, but I like to think it’s due to the speech being well written, well organised and personal.

Even my brother was impressed when I shared it with him!

Since I’ve been publishing this newsletter for over 6 months now and have been writing on my blog, on and off for over 7 years, I feel like writing is having a knock on effect to the way I communicate in general.

Writing has lots of benefits.

- Providing clarity
- Cementing learning
- Eliminating stress
- Increased productivity
- Staying focused

And best of all, if you’re making your writing public it has the ability to leave an impact at scale which can lead to greater opportunities, stronger connections with your audience and further motivation.
