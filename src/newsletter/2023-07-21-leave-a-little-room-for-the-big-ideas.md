In order to gain new knowledge we must first make a little space in our brains.

There is a popular [Zen proverb](https://wiki.c2.com/?EmptyYourCup) which says,

> ‚ÄúIf you truly seek understanding, then first, empty your cup!‚Äù

It‚Äôs a simple philosophy.

If your mind is filled with non-essential thoughts and information, you don‚Äôt have space left to think of the big, game-changing ideas. You need to make space so that new thoughts have somewhere to slot in to.

As [Seth Godin says](https://seths.blog/2023/06/overstuffed/), *‚ÄúThe empty part of the drawer is what makes it a useful tool.‚Äù* If a drawer is completely full, nothing else can be stored in it.

**So how can we make space?**

One good way to make space for new ideas is to [have a digital Inbox](/blog/why-you-need-a-notion-inbox/) where you can dump your thoughts as you have them. You can then dip back into your Inbox from time to time and refine things. This is pretty much [how I organise my ideas for my blog](/blog/why-and-how-i-blog/) and newsletter.

If your todo list is overwhelming and you find it hard to get everything done, [focus on the One Thing](/newsletter/one-thing) that will have the biggest impact and pick 2 or 3 smaller items after that. A lot of todo apps handle this well by having a ‚Äòtoday‚Äô list where you can focus, while tucking the rest of your list out of view.

So get those unnecessary mind-filling thoughts down on paper and out of your brain and make a little room for your next big idea!
