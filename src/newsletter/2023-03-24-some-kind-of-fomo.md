So far this year I’ve been all about forming habits.

I’ve been [learning German](https://www.duolingo.com/profile/ajaykarwal) on Duolingo. Writing more on my blog and in newsletters (like this one). Being more active with [daily walks and weekly running](https://ajaykarwal.com/journey-to-5k/).

And with each day, the dopamine hits of ticking off these habits (mentally, I don’t use any form of tracker… maybe I should?) pushes me to keep going.

But after forming a habit, it can be frustrating if you have to miss out on one due to outside factors.

- Not being able to go for a walk because you child is off sick from school.
- Can't stick to your diet cos you’re not prepping the food.
- Losing your Duolingo streak because your phone battery died.
- *… or one of the thousand other excuses you could find.*

There can be a real ***Frustration Of Missing Out*** when you don't hit your intended goal.

But on a positive note, at least it means that you've formed a strong enough habit that missing a day frustrates you.

And on that note… I’m going for a walk.
