In one of [his daily blog posts](https://seths.blog/2009/02/make-the-world-smaller/), marketing guru Seth Godin says,

> “The secret to being the best in the world is to make the 'world' smaller.”

Being the best in the whole world at anything is impossible to measure, but being the best in ***your*** world is a lot more attainable.

What Seth is talking about in broad terms is not to shoot for an audience that is too big to begin with but rather to narrow down and aim at being the best in a smaller niche.

Being the best in the world at:

- “Design” **(impossible)**
    - “Industrial design for VR headset accessories“ **(achievable)**
- “Landscaping” **(impossible)**
    - “Public school playing field landscaping” **(achievable)**

Whatever your industry, by focusing on a smaller niche, [designing your own category](https://categorypirates.substack.com/p/a-beginners-guide-to-category-design) and building an engaged audience, it’s entirely possible for your audience to believe that you are the best in the world. In *their* world.

One day, you may even make the world’s best cup of coffee!

Until next time,

Ajay 🌍
